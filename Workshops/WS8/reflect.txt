After succesful completion of workshop 8, I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of 
in heritance and polymorphism. Early on in the instructions when we were asked to create getSpecs
It didn't mention that it had to be a virtual function, I unfortunately overlooked that and had to spend
a little bit of time thinking why I was getting the wrong shape printed. This made me read a lot more into
virtual and pure virtual functions and understanding there purpose. After adjusting that error, everything
went relatively smoothly. I feel like Im a lot more comfortable with calling base class constructors and 
ostr and istr types. This workshop has effectively shown the purpose of privacy within modular programming.

For ms3 on the other hand. While copying a string after deallocating some memory, 
I made a syntax error in the form of strlen(str.c_str() + 1), where I wasn't adding
the interger value of one to string length, this resulted in creating a memory leak
where I was copying one more value than the memory I had allocated memory for. This pushed the
break points to point towards the csvRead() line where I Was deallocating memory. This took 
me a few days to find because I was fixing the problem in the wrong sectionss of code. 
I definitely learned to be more careful when writing syntax, on top of the inheritance and 
polymorphism we have been learning between the Patient, ticket, time and IOable classes. 
With the current subject matter we're learning, it definitely feels like the amount of 
syntax required to perform operations has reduced significantly.
Overall both very useful projects.
