Workshop 7 was really helpful in developing my understanding of Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
The first thing I learned is the purpose of calling the base class constructor.
Because Derived classes are constructed in a way such that the base constructor gets called first
the compiler fails to understand or accept a constructor that lacks implementation
on the derived classes end of things. We have to make sure we construct the parent 
class before we can construct the derived class. It all logically makes sense because
a Truck would not be able to inherit properties such as m_licenseplate, address, year built and so forth
and we would only be left with a class named truck, that wouldn't define the object in any sense other
than its carrying capacity and max capacity, in this case leaving 3 different variables within
this object uninitialized. It as well wouldn't be able to inherit its parent classes functions and abilities
such as moveTo and so forth. 

When implementing the function overloads for write, read, I understood the purpose of polymorphism.
In the write and read functions for Truck::, we can see that we can manipulate the output and input stream 
to perform tasks specific to a derived class. In this instance, we called the read function from
Motor vehicle, before appending a specific ostr and istr to our derived class truck. This was very interesting to me
conceptually.
