Part one of the workshop was very useful for refreshing my memory of the elements required in modular programming. 
For starters, I forgot how important and useful header guards could be prior to running into an issue with them in this workshop. 
Having to include ShoppingRec.h in the File.h file also refreshed my understanding of accessing structs in other modules. The rest of part 1
helped with general program knowledge, such as what should be called globally or within a specific scope.
Part 2 on the other hand was very useful for understanding statically allocated memory and iterating through it to access it. 
For instance, iterating through the individual positions within the strings passed to the pointer parameters through out almost all the 
functions we had to implement, and knowing how a len parameter can be used to add a null terminator given the right conditions.
It also helped me understand that although pointers and arrays are synonymous in c++, pointers can be used to take
different addresses in place of fixed values that arrays are limited to.
