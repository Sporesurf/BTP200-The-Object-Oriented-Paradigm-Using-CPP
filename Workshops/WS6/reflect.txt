While implementing MS1, the first thing I learned was when I was implementing the getInt methods while unit testing.
We had to make sure that whatever input we received from the console was a valid integer. After doing some 
reading, I found out that one method of doing such an integrity check in c++ is by taking the input as a string using getline(), 
and passing that string into a stringstream object. Once the stringstream object has the string, you can then use
that string stream object with an insertion operator to initialize an integer if its valid. 
This is definitely something I see my self using in the near future. Other than that, the rest of MS1 was pretty trivial,
however, some of the logic in the Time module did take quite a bit of thinking.

For WS6 on the other hand, I had to spend quite a bit of time debugging unfortunately because of small mistakes I made
when reading the guidelines on how to implement whatever was necessary,
(such a setting pageSize to a safe empty state instead of noOfLines, after already making its value the argument).
But it was excellent practice none the less for operator overloading and implementing the rule of three.
I definitely feel more comfortable now using file streams such and ifstream and ofstream. Overall although
both MS1 and WS6 required a significant amount of work, I feel like my understanding of fundamental c++ has 
grown substantially.
