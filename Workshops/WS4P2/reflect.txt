The first thing that I found the workshop very useful for was my improvement and understanding of this vs *this. Prior to doing it I had some confusion, but when it came down to return the current object in the functions as per request of the workshop. I had to do a little more research and figured out that *this returns a clone of the current object where as "this" returns the actual pointer to the current object. My confusion all along was the syntax because we typically use * to dereference pointers, and & to actually reference them. Moving forward, I will actually understand what the difference is when returning the current object.  

I had faced a little bit of trouble with formatting, for instance in the lab portion, when outputting the dimensional values of the canisters I found my self always missing something. Whether it be fixed floating point notation, or the precision of the values as per the execution sample. Similarly, I had issues in the DIY portion when printing the frames and after mapping out what each value in the statically allocated array I was using to track the value I was printing, things got significantly less confusing and more comprehendible to work with. 

I also had a major logical bug in the Lab portion where I wasn't subtracting the (capacity - volume from contentVolume) of the object argument being passed, but of the actual current object its self. It was a very subtle mistake and after analyzing my code line by line using break points for some time, I was finally able to understand what the error was and was able to fix it right away.  

I definitely feel like my understanding of formatting improved, as well as my overall understanding of constructors and dynamic memory management. I feel extremely comfortable using the methods covered by this workshop and I look forward to using constructors moving forward.
